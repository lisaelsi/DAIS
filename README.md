This is the coursework from the course Design of AI Systems, given at Chalmers University of Technology, spring semester 2023.

### Project (called Genius in the repo as we used the Genius API)
We tackled the challenge of generating song lyrics in the style of the famous rapper Eminem. This was done by creating an AI that built on Eminem lyrics.
